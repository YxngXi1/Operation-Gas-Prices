# Hi there

This is a simple flask project that will help you find the optimized route from your house to your nearest cheapest gas station. I used web scraping to get the locations and then Google Maps APIs to find the path you need. The deisgn still needs work but hopefully you enjoy this project I created!

I'm still a beginner and I'm still learning, so any tips would be great!

# How to get it working on your computer

1. git clone https://github.com/YxngXi1/Operation-Gas-Prices
2. pip install -r requirements. txt
3. flask run
